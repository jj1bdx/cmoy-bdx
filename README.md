# cmoy-bdx headphone amplifier

Information on Chu Moy headphone amplifier, in bdx style, modified by me, Kenji Rikitake.

## What is Chu Moy headphone amplifier?

The Chu Moy amplifier is made of one-chip two-circuit OpAmp, using each circuit for one of the stereo channels.

## Undocumented latest mods

* Replacing OPA2134PA to OPA2604AP caused the chip to self-oscillate. So I removed 47 ohm resistors (R5) and short-circuited them (= zero ohm) between the output terminals of OpAmps and the feedback resistor (R4).  I also add new metal-film resistors of 110 ohm between the output feedback points and the headphone terminals, to reduce effects of reactance connected at the headphone terminals.  This effectively prevented further self-oscillation for the following chips: OPA2134PA, OPA2604AP, NJM4580DD, NJM2043D, and TLE2072.

* The output jack is now 1/4" or 6.5mm diameter jack. No electrical difference, but for compatibility with my headphones.

* C1 (2.2uF between VR and OPamp input) can be removed and short-circuited if the input is guaranteed to be DC voltage free. (In my case I attach a TI PCM2704 USB DAC board to the amplifier with dedicated 2.2uF mylar caps.)

* Choice of input volume: Panasonic's EVJ-Y10F03A14 (available as [Digi-Key part number P2G1103-ND](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/EVJ-Y10F03A14/P2G1103-ND/243525) ) is a very good choice as a 10kohm x 2 audio curve potentiometer. Do not put too much force on each of the connection leads because they are thin and get easily bent.
